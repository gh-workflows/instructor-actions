# GitHub Actions and SDLC

GitHub Actions is a comprehensive CI/CD and automation tool that integrates directly with GitHub repositories. It allows developers to automate workflows for building, testing, and deploying code. 

GitHub Actions is highly versatile, enabling teams to streamline processes throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), which includes stages such as planning, coding, building, testing, releasing, and deploying software. 

By leveraging GitHub Actions, teams can enhance productivity, maintain high code quality, and ensure efficient project management.

## Use Cases Across the SDLC Using GitHub Actions

### Plan

Triage Issues and Project Boards using Actions
- Automated Issue Triage: Automatically label, assign, and categorize issues based on predefined rules. This ensures that issues are organized and prioritized without manual intervention.
- Project Board Updates: Use GitHub Actions to automatically move issues and pull requests across project boards, keeping your project management up-to-date with the current status of tasks.

### Code

Automate Code Builds and Linting upon Pull Request Creation
- Code Linting: Automatically run linting tools on code changes to enforce coding standards and catch potential issues early.
- Automated Builds: Trigger builds whenever a pull request is created or updated to ensure that changes integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase. This provides immediate feedback on build status.

### Build

Compile and Build, Store Artifacts
- Compilation and Build: Use GitHub Actions to compile and build your application, ensuring that every commit results in a working build.
- Artifact Storage: Automatically store build artifacts in a specified location, making them available for later stages in the pipeline or for manual inspection and debugging.

### Test

Automation of Unit Tests and Integration Tests
- Unit Testing: Automatically run unit tests to validate that individual components work as expected.
- Integration Testing: Execute integration tests to ensure that different parts of the application work together correctly. This helps catch issues that might not be apparent from unit tests alone.

### Release

Publish Release, Release Notes, Versioning, and Upload Artifacts
- Automated Releases: Create and publish new releases automatically based on specified triggers, such as merging a pull request into the main branch.
- Release Notes: Generate release notes automatically from commit messages or pull request descriptions, providing a detailed log of changes.
- Versioning: Implement automatic versioning of your software based on semantic versioning principles.
- Upload Artifacts: Upload release artifacts (e.g., binaries, documentation) to GitHub Releases or other storage services for distribution.

### Deploy

Deploy Applications to Your Chosen Environment
- Continuous Deployment: Automatically deploy applications to your chosen environments (e.g., staging, production) once they pass all required tests.
- Multi-Environment Support: Configure workflows to deploy to multiple environments, ensuring that your application is tested in staging before being promoted to production.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use tools like Terraform or Azure Resource Manager within GitHub Actions to manage and deploy infrastructure along with your application.

### Conclusion

GitHub Actions provides a powerful platform to automate and streamline processes across the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). From planning and coding to building, testing, releasing, and deploying, GitHub Actions can help maintain high standards of code quality and efficiency. By integrating automation at every stage, teams can focus on delivering value and improving software reliability.
